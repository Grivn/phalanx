# Phalanx: An Asynchronous Order-Fairness Byzantine Consensus Protocol

## Introduction
Generally, a BFT (*Byzantine Fault Tolerance*) consensus algorithm concentrates on two properties, *safety* and *liveness*. 
Well, in the system on reality, we should also pay attention to the order of transactions, in which an incorrect order may make the tasks failed.
For instance, here is an instant commodity trading system. 
In such a system, we should send a *trading-transaction* for it if we would like to buy something.
After the process of this transaction, the commodity you prefer would be locked.
When only one consumer is trying to buy one commodity and sending *trading-transaction*, it is easy to process. 
But if there are several people trying to buy one thing at the same time, a concurrency problem will occur, 
and the order of *trading-transactions* could decide who the commodity belongs to.
In this situation, the order of transactions would be important for trading fairness.

With most BFT algorithm, especially the partially synchronous protocols, such as PBFT[[1]](#refer-anchor-1) [[2]](#refer-anchor-2) and HotStuff[[3]](#refer-anchor-3), 
we cannot deal with the problem about fairness of transaction order because of the proposal generation process.
In most BFT protocols, a proposal is usually generated by one specific node, and the participants could only detect
limited malicious manners of proposer, such as *fork-attack* or *silence-attack*. 
As the proposer could make a decision on the content of proposals, it could decide the order the 
transactions on purpose to make some of them failed, which cannot be detected as normal.

So that, in *CRYPTO2020*, [[4]](#refer-anchor-4) introduced a new kind of property for BFT called *order-fairness*, 
which indicates a trusted order for transactions. The author has also proposed a new class of consensus protocols called Aequitas, 
which are the first to achieve *order-fairness* in both *synchronous* and "asynchronous" situations. 
However, the Aequitas are difficult to implement, and there are not any experiments for the performance of them. 
To make it more practical, in *USENIX2020*, [[5]](#refer-anchor-5) proposed a consensus protocol
called Pompe, which could also achieve the *order-fairness* under the partially synchronous BFT protocols, 
and did some experiments on it. But it is difficult for us to use Pompe in asynchronous situation, 
as the order of commands in it is decided by *trusted-timestamp*.

So that, we propose a brand-new protocol called *Phalanx*. It is an order-fairness byzantine fault tolerance protocol 
to achieve *order-fairness* property. It could become a plugin for most kinds of BFT protocol, 
which means a traditional BFT protocol could complete the order-fairness property easily with the accession of *Phalanx*.
In addition, the Phalanx protocol could also be used in asynchronous situation, we have proposed *Async-Phalanx* to achieve it.

## Background
The development of BFT protocols, the importance for order-fairness property, and some research on it.

## Phalanx Phase
### Overview

### Roles
#### Client
The client would like to execute *command* should broadcast it to all the replicas.

#### Replica
Every replica in phalanx cluster should maintain a *selfish-order* for the commands received from clients.
The replica itself should be responsible for the *selfish-order* that there wouldn't be any byzantine problems on it.

### Selfish-Order Protocol
We can regard it as a fixed-leader BFT cluster in which we use a byzantine quorum system here to detect *fork-attack*.

#### Pre-Order
While receiving a command from clients, the replica will assign a specific sequence number for it 
and generate pre-order to notify other participants.
- <PRE-ORDER i, n, d, command-d, t>

#### Vote
While receiving a pre-order from other replica, verify it according to sequence number.
We should make sure that the sequence number is increasing one by one, and then, send a signed vote back if the pre-order is valid.
- <VOTE i, d, sig>

#### Order
The node waiting for quorum votes about its pre-order. If the votes has reached quorum size, aggregate them and generate
a quorum-cert (QC) for pre-order, and broadcast order message. The node received order message would store it by order.
- <ORDER i, n, d, command-d, t, QC>

### Synchronous Phalanx Interface
Interfaces for phalanx protocol that we could use them to make a traditional synchronous BFT protocol achieve *order-fairness* property.

#### Generator
It is used to generate a phalanx-proposal. rules

#### Communicator
It is used to communicate with each other.

#### Validator
It is used for verification of phalanx order during normal BFT process. rules

#### Executor
It is used to execute the phalanx-proposal after the BFT consensus. rules

### Proof
Proof for properties, safety, liveness and order-fairness.
#### Safety
- safety of selfish-order.
- safety of validator.

#### Liveness
- liveness of selfish-order.
- liveness of validator.

#### Order-Fairness
- order-fairness of generator&executor.
