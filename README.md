## Introduction
Generally, a BFT (*Byzantine Fault Tolerance*) consensus algorithm concentrates on two properties, *safety* and *liveness*. 
Well, in the system on reality, we should also pay attention to the order of transactions, in which an incorrect order may make the tasks failed.
For instance, here is an instant commodity trading system. 
In such a system, we should send a *trading-transaction* for it if we would like to buy something.
After the process of this transaction, the commodity you prefer would be locked.
When only one consumer is trying to buy one commodity and sending *trading-transaction*, it is easy to process. 
But if there are several people trying to buy one thing at the same time, a concurrency problem will occur, 
and the order of *trading-transactions* could decide who the commodity belongs to.
In this situation, the order of transactions would be important for trading fairness.

With most BFT algorithm, especially the partially synchronous protocols, such as PBFT[[1]](#refer-anchor-1) [[2]](#refer-anchor-2) and HotStuff[[3]](#refer-anchor-3), 
we cannot deal with the problem about fairness of transaction order because of the proposal generation process.
In most BFT protocols, a proposal is usually generated by one specific node, and the participants could only detect
limited malicious manners of proposer, such as *fork-attack* or *silence-attack*. 
As the proposer could make a decision on the content of proposals, it could decide the order the 
transactions on purpose to make some of them failed, which cannot be detected as normal.

So that, in *CRYPTO2020*, [[4]](#refer-anchor-4) introduced a new kind of property for BFT called *order-fairness*, 
which indicates a trusted order for transactions. The author has also proposed a new class of consensus protocols called Aequitas, 
which are the first to achieve *order-fairness* in both *synchronous* and "asynchronous" situations. 
However, the Aequitas are difficult to implement, and there are not any experiments for the performance of them. 
To make it more practical, in *OSDI2020*, [[5]](#refer-anchor-5) proposed a consensus protocol
called Pompe, which could also achieve the *order-fairness* under the partially synchronous BFT protocols, 
and did some experiments on it. But it is difficult for us to use Pompe in asynchronous situation, 
as the order of commands in it is decided by *trusted-timestamp*.

So that, we propose a brand-new protocol called *Phalanx*. It is an order-fairness byzantine fault tolerance protocol 
to achieve *order-fairness* property. It could become a plugin for most kinds of BFT protocol, 
which means a traditional BFT protocol could complete the order-fairness property easily with the accession of *Phalanx*.
Besides, *Phalanx* has a higher maximum throughput and has lower latency while processing blocks with large size.
We find that *Phalanx* has a more stable throughput if the cluster changes leader frequently.

## Background
The development of BFT protocols, the importance for order-fairness property, and some research on it.

## Phalanx Phase
### Overview

### Roles
#### Proposer
The proposer would like to generate *command* with the transactions it has received.

#### Replica
Each replica in phalanx cluster has a *private-order* for the commands.
The private-order could be different from each other.

### Private-Order Protocol
We can regard it as a fixed-leader BFT cluster in which we use a byzantine quorum system here to detect *fork-attack*.

#### Pre-Order
While receiving a command from clients, the replica will assign a specific sequence number for it 
and generate pre-order to notify other participants.
- <PRE-ORDER i, n, d, command-d, pre-d, t>

#### Vote
While receiving a pre-order from other replica, verify it according to sequence number.
We should make sure that the sequence number is increasing one by one, and then, send a signed vote back if the pre-order is valid.
- <VOTE i, d, sig>

#### Order
The node waiting for quorum votes about its pre-order. If the votes has reached quorum size, aggregate them and generate
a quorum-cert (QC) for pre-order, and broadcast order message. The node received order message would store it by order.
- <ORDER i, n, d, command-d, t, QC>

### Consensus
Interfaces for phalanx protocol that we could use them to make a traditional synchronous BFT protocol achieve *order-fairness* property.

#### Generator
It is used to generate a phalanx-proposal. The proposal here has a determined size.

#### Verifier
It could be used to verify the validation of each proposal, including the aggregated signature and the sequential order
the global consensus has found.

### Executor
It is used to execute the phalanx-proposal after the BFT consensus. 
We should find the query stream at first which indicates the partial orders we should commit.
When we execute phalanx proposals, we would generate a fairness order for the commands.

#### Status

##### correct sequenced command (CSC)

##### quorum sequenced command (QSC)

##### waiting command

##### leaf command

##### committed command

### Proof
Proof for properties, safety, liveness and order-fairness.
#### Safety
##### safety of private-order

##### safety of consensus

#### Liveness
##### liveness of private-order
##### liveness of consensus

#### Order-Fairness
##### order fairness
##### limited order correctness

### Involution
